		<h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
		<p>I am so thrilled to launch our new website for our school community. I have been wanting a site like this for years and it is finally done! We had all the resources, lessons, facts, etc...... everything on another site and it was just very scattered and was not user friendly. I have had the best experience with the website builder, Cat, as she worked with me to make sure all of this information was in an easily accessible format for teachers and students. What took years for our department to put together only took a short amount of time for the website to be built. I still can't believe it is done!! THANK YOU!

		<p>I cannot say enough good things about My School Design and Cat the person who was my web developer. First of all, Cat is so great to work with and very knowledgeable about every aspect of design and all of the other aspects of launching a website. I was concerned with the fact that I am in the US and she is in the UK. She seemed to never sleep. I can't think of a time when she didn't answer me right away when I had questions. The communication was top notch. She followed my instructions perfectly and our website looks just like I had pictured in my mind. The Builder was a bit intimidating to me at first but the more I use it the more I see that it is not that hard to use at all. They have great help with the videos and explanations on how to use the Builder. I haven't used it that much yet but so far what I have done has been very easy to do after using their training.</p>
		<p>I highly recommend this company for your website design needs. I really can't think of one reason why anyone should no use My School Design.</p>

		<p>I really appreciate the team of My School Design for assisting me in the entire process of building our website. Cat was particularly helpful and open to suggestions, responsive to inquiries, and took careful note of my tastes and preferences. Thank you My School Design!</p>
